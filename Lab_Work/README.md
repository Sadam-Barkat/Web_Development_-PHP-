## Project Overview

This repository contains my lab work for PHP programming, featuring exercises and small projects that demonstrate key programming concepts. The work covers different aspects of PHP development, from basic syntax to working with databases and user authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP** - Server-side scripting language for dynamic web applications
- **MySQL** - For database integration and data management
- **HTML/CSS** - For structuring and styling web pages
- **Apache/Nginx** - Web server for running PHP locally

## Lab Work Examples

The lab work includes the following tasks:

1. **Basic PHP Syntax** - Simple scripts to demonstrate PHP syntax, variables, and operators.
2. **Form Handling** - PHP scripts that process form data, including validation and error handling.
3. **Database Integration** - PHP scripts that connect to a MySQL database and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - PHP classes and objects, including inheritance and polymorphism.
5. **User Authentication** - A simple login system using PHP sessions and MySQL.
6. **Error Handling** - Demonstrations of PHP's error handling techniques.
