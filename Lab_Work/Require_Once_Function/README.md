# PHP `require_once` Function

Welcome to the `require_once` function repository! This folder contains examples of using PHPâ€™s `require_once` function to include files in PHP scripts. The `require_once` function ensures that a file is included only once during the execution of the script, preventing errors from multiple inclusions.

## Project Overview

This folder focuses on demonstrating the use of the `require_once` function in PHP. The examples highlight the best practices for including files in your PHP projects, including classes, configuration files, and functions, while ensuring that a file is included only once.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP** - Server-side scripting language to demonstrate file inclusion
- **HTML/CSS** - For structuring and styling web pages (if applicable)
- **Apache/Nginx** - Web server for running PHP locally

## Examples of `require_once`

The following examples demonstrate different use cases of the `require_once` function in PHP:

1. **Basic File Inclusion**: Including a single PHP file only once in the script to avoid redeclaration errors.
2. **Class Autoloading**: Using `require_once` to include class files dynamically.
3. **Configuration Files**: Including configuration files such as database settings or application constants.
4. **Including Functions**: Ensuring that a functions file is only included once to prevent function redefinitions.
